## Project Introduction

The IPL Analysis Dashboard is an interactive data visualization project developed using Tableau to analyze and present key insights from historical Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket data. With the increasing importance of data-driven decision-making in sports analytics, this project focuses on converting complex match and player statistics into clear, meaningful, and visually engaging dashboards.

The dashboard enables users to explore season-wise IPL performance, including team standings, match outcomes, and top-performing players such as Orange Cap and Purple Cap holders. By leveraging Tableau’s powerful visualization and filtering capabilities, users can dynamically analyze trends across multiple seasons and compare team and player performances with ease.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data analysis, data visualization, and business intelligence by transforming raw datasets into actionable insights. It is designed for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and beginners in data analytics who want to understand how real-world sports data can be effectively analyzed and presented using modern BI tools.
